HTML - Define the strcuture and content of a web page.

Elements: basic components of an HTML page. They are containers for content. 
Tags: define the start and the end of an html element. They go between < >, and they're usually disposed like <tag> ... </tag> 

Some elements do not have a closing tag (empty elements, don't wrap any content).

ALLWAYS the homepage of the website must be defined in a file called 'index.html'.

DOCTYPE: tells the browser the html version and hence how to render the page. We use <!DOCTYPE html>
HTML element: root element of the document. 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"> 

	<head>
		<title> Generic Page </title> 
		<meta charset = "utf-8">  // sets the encoding
	</head>

	<body>
		
	</body>

</html>

lang is an ATTRIBUTE that specifies the language of the text content within that element.
